# Twirrer- A frontend Twitter clone 

Functionality: 
* Two log in pages - either by typing email and password in default main page, or by clicking on Sign Up / Log in in the main page
 - Sign up / Log in button in main page leads directly to dedicated log in page
 - Logging in directly from main page leads to an example newsfeed, unless one of the fields is left empty, in which case a pop-up will appear and user will be rerouted to the dedicated sign in page
 * News feed page that contains a feed, sidebar for Account Info and a working Post button
